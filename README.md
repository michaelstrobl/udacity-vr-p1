Udacity VR Nanodegree Project 1 Hello VR World
by Michael Strobl

In this project you can experience my first simple Unity application on your Android phone.
It has 3 features when you push on the buttons below you.
- dropping 10 cubes
- changing particles above you
- switch from day to night (and vice versa)

How long did I take?

It took me around 2 hours to complete. I had no experience in Unity and Android.
- 30 minutes for the Unity VR App
- 60 minutes for installing Android SKD and converting the Unity app to an Android APK
- 30 minutes for polishing

What I liked?
- first experience in Unity
- navigating in Unity

What I didn't like?
- 2 or 3 more functions would be nice
